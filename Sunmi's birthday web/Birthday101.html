            MY pretty fine shyt <br>
            I added this last and I curated the text last,
Mehn spent so many hours on this website,i lost a lot of sleeep too,I even got questioned on why I was doing it but I had to ,it’s not half of what you deserve but it’s what I can give now with little sacrifices.
We have spent so time arguing,fighting and falling apart,we seem to have  forgotten how much we love each other. <br>
You are such a QUEEN. <br>
I remember borrowing your charger for the first time,you didn’t come to get it for hours,I was like won’t this girl use her charger ,then you got my number from Moses and we would made small talks about Priscilla’s wedding,my sisters inter house sports and sometimes we would even compliment each other,It was cute. <br>
I think my birthday is our friendship anniversary,cause you were so apologetic about not making it to my birthday outing,you took me to item 7,which became our second home😭😂,it’s crazy how much we went there,once every week.Geez
And suddenly ShopRite became our 3rd home,most of our pictures being from there and screenshots of videos,We need more pics this year.All this places hold memories of us  that we carry silently, I hope and pray we get past whatever fall out that might almost regard us cutting each other off. <br>
i really am greatful for you in my life,for all the impacts you have had on me,I am greatful for all our Adventures,all the times we spent Together and i am greatful for YOU. <br>
You are such a good person, and i pray you show the world how much of an amazing person that you are and i pray the world sees you for your unique qualities,your essence,your beauty and your brains <br>
You have really being a big part of my 2025,half of it was about you,about US.
Thank you for being a best friend,a sister,a supporter and my shoulder to rely on.
2035 wouldn’t have been better without you. <br>
Happy birthday my pretty Sunmi❤️

        <p>
            I chose this song because I love you,you probably already know this but I thought it’d be fine to let you know again,No matter how much i argue or get hurt,it feels inevitable to not love you.We have had so many ups and downs through this friendship and it hasn’t even been a year😭, I guess they are just to test waters.. <br>
My pretty 5’9 girlie with brown eyes <br>
My tall girl. <br>
I love your resilience,your strength,your admiration,your self dedication,I love your ability to reach beyond and above your limit. <br>
I don’t have much to say for this content other than I LOVE YOU.
We have spent so much fights forgetting that the reason we won’t let go is because we love each other.
I really do love you,whatever goodness I have shown to you are always from a place of love and realness.A lot of I love yous here but yh
P.S I LOVE YOU.
